title: Welcome to Muninn Hall
---

Muninn Hall is a community for Matrix homeserver staff. Be that your homeserver administrators or custodial / janitorial moderators.

We exist to provide a space for Matrix homeserver staff to gather and pool their knowledge but also to collaborate on matters. Be that Trust and Safety or systems administration or more.

Our website exists to provide a space for shared documentation and also as an advertising tool ofc for this community as its easier to share than a Matrix room to get to know what we are about.

## How to join?

The process for joining Muninn Hall starts with a senior member of the homeserver staff passing the screening in [#muninn-hall-screening:feline.support](https://matrix.to/#/muninn-hall-screening:feline.support).  
After that is done, the rest of the homeserver staff can be invited to the space.

The easiest way to pass, is for the staff member to be listed in the [MSC1929 well-known/matrix/support](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.12/client-server-api/#getwell-knownmatrixsupport) record.

### Who qualifies?

Homeserver admins of open registration homeservers or homeservers with sufficiently established reputation is the primary way to pass through the door. Established reputation is handled under the so-called Legend rule.

The Legend rule is easiest to put into words as that your reputation is sufficiently established that only a fool would question if you can bring value to our community. Long time homeserver admins who have been in the trenches with us for years have knowledge that is invaluable. In this era of information silos and information decay, having access to some of these repositories of knowledge can prove to be of immeasurable value.

## Why yet another admin community?

Muninn Hall was founded due to critical flaws in the previous infrastructure. It is not polite to go into the nature of the extremely severe accusations involved in this format so they won’t be mentioned here.

## Site Navigation

Our shared documentation is ofc under the documentation section and our future blog is under blog.

The blog will feature things like updates about Muninn Hall but also can feature writings by us all as a group.

## Code of Conduct

Before we go into the code of conduct itself, it should be mentioned that Muninn Hall is moderated in accordance with the principles of Custodial Moderation as presented by Cat in https://neko.support/blog/2025-07-11/cats-views-on-moderation-terminology

It is the belief of the staff of Muninn Hall that most of our membership should only need the instructions of: behave in a somewhat professional capacity and be excellent towards each other. But we also recognise that people need to be told what not to do. So here is a list of what to Definitively not do in general.
